📦 Counting Number of Objects Using Python and OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to detect and count distinct objects in an image using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It uses pre-processing techniques like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection to isolate objects and then counts them using contour detection.

✅ Features
   Accurate detection of multiple and overlapping objects

   Image pre-processing for noise reduction

   Object boundary highlighting and count display

   Easy-to-modify codebase for different object types

   Visual output using Matplotlib

🛠️ Tech Stack
   Python 3.x

   OpenCV

   NumPy

   Matplotlib

📁 How It Works
   Load the input image

   Convert to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur

   Detect edges using Canny Edge Detection

   Find contours of detected shapes

   Draw contours and display total object count
